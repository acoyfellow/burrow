  html: `<p>On an instance in <code>cloudflare</code> mode, people sign in with their Cloudflare account. coil then runs their model calls on <b>their</b> Workers AI and AI Gateway. The instance owner never pays for anyone else&rsquo;s inference, and never needs their keys.</p>
<p>This is the part that makes coil a template, not only an app. Anyone can ship a product on Cloudflare that runs on its users&rsquo; inference. Every new user is a Cloudflare account doing real work on Workers AI and AI Gateway.</p>
<h3>What happens when you sign in</h3>
<ol>
<li>coil sends you to Cloudflare&rsquo;s consent screen. You pick one account.</li>
<li>coil receives a token limited to these scopes: <code>user-details.read</code>, <code>account-settings.read</code>, <code>ai.read</code>, <code>ai.write</code>, <code>aig.read</code>, <code>aig.run</code>, and <code>offline_access</code> to stay signed in.</li>
<li>coil lists the account&rsquo;s AI Gateways and uses one with <b>authentication turned on</b>. It prefers the instance&rsquo;s <code>COIL_USER_GATEWAY</code>, then <code>default</code>, then the first one.</li>
<li>Each turn, coil refreshes the token if needed and calls the gateway with it. If the grant is gone, the turn fails. It never falls back to the instance&rsquo;s own AI.</li>
</ol>
